Create links from brief results to individual stack charts

This requires a fair amount of customization to make applicable to another institution.
1. Gather the necessary information to use in your logic statements: availability status, library location, library sublocation, call numbers, etc.
2. Build your logic. This code separates LC call numbers from SuDoc and Dewey, so that each one can be manipulated differently.
3. Assign the stack chart url to each logic statement (or group of statements).
4. Create a boolean to define the circumstances under which the stack chart url should display.
5. Add text to the template url for display.
